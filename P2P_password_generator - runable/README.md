Named P2P, this is the projecto for a password generator, this webapp allow the user to create complex passwords re-elaborating data colected from images  choosed by the user from his/her device memory, along with a word (suggesting something related to the previous mentioned image) and a seed.
Every time the user chooses the same combination of image and word, the same password will be generated. 

This relieves the user from the need to invent and memorize complex passwords.

The only thing the user should memorize is that correlated word, and obviously to keep the image into device's memory.

After the generation, the outcome password can be copied in the user notes by clickin on a button;
so he/she can easily paste the password in any other page or app. helping to avoid any keylogger attacks or spiyng during digitation (widespread practice among private investigators).

thsi is a demo  version, i know that there are severe security risk aboudt data aching from client side.
futher developments will incude security measures about the crypted comunication of generated string and the epires of all data from client side.
